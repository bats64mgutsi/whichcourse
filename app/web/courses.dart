        This aim of this course is to introduce the study of archaeology, and
        the study of human origins. Archaeology is defined as the study of the
        human past through material culture. Over the second semester, this
        course presents an overview of prehistory leading up to the modern day,
        as well as the broader climatic, geographic, ecological, social, and
        cultural contexts which made modern humans. In particular, it looks at
        the past through the lens of what people leave behind - the
        archaeological record.
      </p><p class=\"p79 ft3\">What you can expect to take away from this course:</p><p class=\"p562 ft9\">
        •A broad understanding of the timescales of human prehistory, and our
        interactions with the Earth System, from the Early Pleistocene through
        to the Historical period, and the emergence of present day societies
        (the \"Anthropocene\").
      </p><p class=\"p562 ft12\">
        •An understanding of current concepts in archaeological thought, and the
        complexities of relationships between archaeologists, science, and
        society today.
      </p><p class=\"p562 ft9\">
        •Familiarity with the foundational skills and terminology necessary for
        <nobr>present-day</nobr> archaeological research and investigation.
      </p><p class=\"p562 ft9\">
        This broad course is suitable for all undergraduate students in the
        sciences and humanities; but particularly for those wishing to major in
        Archaeology, Environmental &amp; Geographical Science, or cognate subjects.

        In AGE2011S we examine the record of primate and human evolution,
        showing how fossil skeletons and artefacts are interpreted in terms of
        human behaviour and evolutionary processes. We also consider genetic and
        other comparative evidence that are increasingly providing insight into
        the origin of our lineage. We answer questions such as: Why did our
        ancestors evolve in Africa? How did we evolve such large and complex
        brains? What advantage does bipedalism provide? When do humans begin to
        make tools? Why is human skin colour so variable? What makes humans
        unique? The syllabus for AGE2011S includes practical sessions for the
        study of primate and human, fossil and recent skeletal material and the
        artefacts associated with our ancestors.

        In this course we explore the history of Africa’s people over the past
        2000 years with special reference to southern Africa. Why are southern
        African populations so diverse? What lies behind the linguistic map that

        shaped the evolution of societies? Did Africa have any civilisations?

        Diversity and evolution of life histories and reproductive systems in

        including roots, stems and leaves in relation to strategies for resource

        How are organisms and ecosystems affected by the drivers of global

        and anthropogenic (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions, pollution,
        <nobr>land-use</nobr> change), and then examine how these drivers
        influence (and are influenced by) terrestrial and marine biological
        systems. We cover a variety of topics, ranging from organismal and

        biogeochemical cycles, ecological function and ecosystem services. While
        the majority of the class is focussed on contemporary global change,

        In an era of \"big data\", the ability to work with large amounts of
        numerical data is an important skill. Biological systems are notoriously
        complex across all levels of organisation, and are often difficult to
        manipulate experimentally on meaningful temporal and spatial scales.
        Mathematical models provide a means of gaining insight into such
        systems, allowing us to disentangle complicated processes, focus on
        variables of interest to a particular research question, test
        alternative hypotheses, make predictions, and help present ideas in an
        unambiguous fashion. This course deals with the use, interpretation, and
        limits of modelling approaches in biology. In a series of modules
        exploring processes ranging from the behaviour of genes to understanding
        global scale distributions of species and communities, students will
        gain experience in question formulation, model development and
        parameterisation, interpretation of results, and model critique.

        Spatial thinking sits at the core of Geographical scholarship, and space
        and human societies are always mutually constitutive. This course
        explores how geographers have theorised space and place as central to
        understanding historical processes, social relations and cultural
        practices. Focusing particularly on Africa and other regions of the
        global South, the course covers foundational Human Geography concepts
        including modernity, landscape, memory, heritage, identity and
        inclusion. Through theoretical work and
        <nobr>field-based</nobr> experiential learning, we examine how space and
        place both shape and are shaped by a range of power dynamics.

        This course looks at the underlying dynamics involved in the negotiation
        of environmental policy and its implementation. The assumption here is
        that unsustainable outcomes are not a result of a lack of will or
        intention, but rather due to vastly varying values, knowledge and data
        that are brought to bear on decision making for the environment. The
        approach of this course is to challenge the ‘cultural embeddedness’ of
        policy i.e. it critiques the cultural processes underlying environmental
        policy. A deeper understanding of the cultural politics of environmental
        policy and practice will deal with the processes through which
        institutions define and mediate policy outcomes; governance arrangements
        for sustainable development; the roles of power, rationality, knowledge
        and values in achieving environmental and social justice.

        The global South is urbanising at roughly twice the rate of the global
        North, yet dominant narratives of 'the city' continue to privilege
        London, Los Angeles and Paris over Lagos, Johannesburg and Mumbai. This
        course explores how cities of the global South are generating new bodies
        of theory, new forms of social life, and new imaginaries. It does this
        through novels, films and other textual and visual representations of
        everyday urbanism, drawing on contemporary theory from the global South
        to help make sense of these discourses. Situated in the rapidly evolving
        field of Urban Studies, the course aims to open up conversations across
        disciplines about the cities we are in and the cities we desire.
        Students will be expected to read set texts, both fictional and
        theoretical, and watch set films, in preparation for classes which will
        take the form of weekly, <nobr>student-led</nobr> seminars.

        Located at the interface of <nobr>fast-changing</nobr> genetic and
        information technologies, and the juncture of a range of social,
        environmental and ethical concerns, the <nobr>so-called</nobr>
        <nobr>bio-economy</nobr> has changed ways in which biodiversity is used,
        conserved and commercialised. Although often touted as a panacea for
        energy crises, livelihoods, environmental remediation and food security,
        critical questions have been raised about who stands to benefit, the
        involvement of local communities, and economic and political drivers
        behind the <nobr>bio-economy</nobr> \"push\". Using a political ecology
        framing, this interdisciplinary course aims to introduce key theories
        that situate the <nobr>bio-economy</nobr> and to deepen understandings
        about the nature of emerging debates. These range from contestations
        about genetically modified crops, and 'biopiracy' charges of patenting
        biodiversity and traditional knowledge, through to the potential of
        agroecology as a sustainable agricultural future. The course aims to
        deepen critical thinking around these questions, and to inspire a
        scholarship that explores possibilities for socially just and
        environmentally sustainable approaches, with a particular focus on the
        Global South. The course involves both theory and practice, drawing on
        research mostly from <nobr>Sub-Saharan</nobr> Africa. Students will be
        expected to read set texts, to watch set videos, and to prepare
        seminars. The course includes several short fieldtrips. For more

        Compromised air quality is a major environmental concern, especially in
        urban environments and even more so in cities in developing parts of the
        world. This course explores the current state of global air quality but
        with a focus on examples and case studies from the global south,
        particularly Africa. We will investigate the factors and role players
        that have an influence on air quality, the distribution of polluted
        versus clean air and the impacts on people and the environment. This
        module will look at the different scales at which people are exposed to
        poor air quality and the data and tools we use to study and monitor the
        atmosphere at these different scales and explore the potential for
        locally developed interventions and solutions. We will also look at air
        quality management and how the current
        <nobr>socio-economic</nobr> situation is reflected in this space with
        specific reference to South and southern Africa. Students will be
        expected to identify an air quality issue of their choice, find and
        interpret relevant literature, appropriate datasets and methods and
        produce results which will culminate in a short research report with

        The aim of this module is to introduce students to both the theory and
        practice of urban ecology. Students will be expected to engage
        critically with current theories and debates as presented in the urban
        ecology literature. In addition to this, there will be a significant
        focus on practical methods and skills. Students will be expected to
        interrogate the urban landscape, identify and pose relevant ecological
        questions, and design and implement appropriate methods to answer these
        ecological questions. Broad theoretical areas to be engaged in, all in
        the context of the city, include: biogeography, alien invasion,
        landscape fragmentation, conservation, restoration, ecosystem services,
        and social ecology. At the NQF 9 level students will be expected to
        apply theoretical considerations in engaging in questions that speak to
        more than one area of urban ecology, for example speaking simultaneously
        to urban design and climate change. This expectation will be assessed in
        both the class essay and in the exam. At the NQF 9 level their ability
        to simultaneously apply theoretical considerations across different
        areas of urban ecology will be assessed throughout the course.

        environmental changes at different spatial and temporal scales, place
        their area of study into the geological, Quaternary, climatic and

        This course looks at the underlying dynamics involved in the negotiation
        of environmental policy and its implementation. The assumption here is
        that unsustainable outcomes are not a result of a lack of will or
        intention, but rather due to vastly varying values, knowledge and data
        that are brought to bear on decision making for the environment. The
        approach of this course is to challenge the ‘cultural embeddedness’ of
        policy i.e. it critiques the cultural processes underlying environmental
        policy. A deeper understanding of the cultural politics of environmental
        policy and practice will deal with the processes through which
        institutions define and mediate policy outcomes; governance arrangements
        for sustainable development; the roles of power, rationality, knowledge
        and values in achieving environmental and social justice. At the NQF 9
        level students will be expected to apply theory to appropriate areas of
        application in the realm of urban environmental policy. Masters level
        students will be assigned two presentations and subsequent written
        submissions, with an emphasis on the application of theoretical
        considerations. The extended policy analysis assignment will contain
        additional analytical variables to ensure a higher level of analysis.

        The global South is urbanising at roughly twice the rate of the global
        North, yet dominant narratives of 'the city' continue to privilege
        London, Los Angeles and Paris over Lagos, Johannesburg and Mumbai. This
        course explores how cities of the global South are generating new bodies
        of theory, new forms of social life, and new imaginaries. It does this
        through novels, films and other textual and visual representations of
        everyday urbanism, drawing on contemporary theory from the global South
        to help make sense of these discourses. Situated in the rapidly evolving
        field of Urban Studies, the course aims to open up conversations across
        disciplines about the cities we are in and the cities we desire.
        Students will be expected to read set texts, both fictional and

        outlining and discussing dominant historical and current environmental
        governance theories, models and approaches at the global level. The
        course then engages with various economic, political, historical,
        institutional and social drivers that influence environmental governance

        This course explores and critically engages with geographical research
        related to sexuality, with a particular focus on the interrelationships
        between identity, place and health. The course explores how geographical
        thinking on sexuality – and in particular on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and
        Trans (LGBT) groups – has evolved over time, and the key relationships
        that have emerged between the study of sexuality and the study of health
        needs and inequalities. Starting with an exploration of the historical
        roots of the geographies of sexualities literature the course will go on
        to explore the connections such work has had with wider
        <nobr>post-structuralist</nobr> queer theories, globalization debates,
        and research on sexualities drawn from <nobr>sub-Saharan</nobr> Africa.
        The course will then situate such work in relation to the development of
        work on HIV/ AIDS prevention, treatment and care, by considering how
        sexualities have been variously framed, and the at times limited
        conceptual space for an appreciation of diverse sexual identities. The
        course then draws together these various strands to consider the options
        and possibilities for current HIV programming in Cape Town for LGBT
        groups together with a critical examination of the epidemiological
        logics and conceptual challenges of the public health deployment of ‘men

        advanced analytical methods (system analysis, and computer and
        mathematical models) to help make better decisions. The OR in
        Development programme focuses on preparing graduates for a career in
        applying OR to the unique problems of the developing world, such as
        conflicting objectives in balancing, for example,
        <nobr>socio-economic</nobr> development and corrective actions, less
        reliable infrastructures, and a <nobr>post-colonial</nobr> need for
        community participation in all levels of planning. The first academic
        year is based primarily on coursework, supplemented by group discussions
        and case studies. The coursework includes the basic techniques of
        operational research and statistics, specific developmental issues,
        problem structuring and decision analysis.

        Problem Structuring: We explore a number of tools and methods which
        support the initial phases of a process of enquiry or analysis. Our
        interest is in understanding both the epistemological basis of different
        approaches as well as evaluating the extent to which they add rigour and
        promote insight. We will be critiquing the efficacy of different
        approaches through a variety of case studies. System Dynamics: We
        discuss features that result in complexity of systems, with case
        studies. These are then represented first qualitatively and then
        quantitatively in simulation studies using appropriate software (Vensim
        is proposed). The course may not be offered every year.

        This course aims to build on the practical and conceptual work focused
        on the challenges and urgencies of southern urbanism that students
        undertake in the first semester in the City Research Studio, Urban
        Everyday and/or Urban Theory, and zeroes in on the problem of adapting
        these lessons for the realm of urban governance and regulation. The
        central question then is this: What does critical policy look like from
        the vantage point of African cities? The course will seek to offer
        answers to this question primarily by adopting a design perspective:
        byapplying a design lens to think about space and politics and what
        alternative modes of regulation are possible (given, for instance,
        constant technological innovation) and necessary (given the multipleand
        intersecting crises of accesstowater, food, housing and other basic
        needs). The central aim of the course is to facilitate students' process
        to map, interpret and devise regulatory modes and practices of urban
        intervention that are capable of meaningfully addressing the most
        pressing problems of our cities and transform the places where people
        live.
