        performed under the close guidance of a suitably qualified supervisor/s.
        The dissertation should be <nobr>well-conceived</nobr> and acknowledge
        earlier research in the field. It should demonstrate the ability to
        undertake a substantial and informed piece of research, and to collect,

        The academic disciplines of chemistry, chemical biology and biophysics
        have a critical dependence on computer simulation and large scale data
        analysis to understand observed phenomena and advance the frontiers of
        disciplinary knowledge. This course aims to prepare students to
        undertake research in computational science as applied to chemistry,
        chemical biology, biophysics and chemical physics. The two streams of
        focus are computation and informatics. The course will commence with
        project assignment followed by a combination of
        <nobr>in-house</nobr> and online short training
        <nobr>(non-credit)</nobr> courses in: Scientific Computing, High
        Performance Computing, Computational Methods for Data Analysis, Data
        Management, R Programming, Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics.
        The above short training courses are designed to prepare students to
        successfully complete a computational science project and dissertation.

          examinations is required in each of CSC5005H and CSC5006H. A module
          can be repeated once only; two unsuccessful attempts constitute a
          fail. A student who accumulates two failed modules will not be
          permitted to continue. To pass each course an overall average of at
          least 50% is required.

          In the course, a framework for describing the operation of computer
          networks is developed. Within this framework, we start with the
          operation of <nobr>local-area</nobr> networks,
          <nobr>packet-switched</nobr> networks and the Internet. After this,
          the module moves to the uses made of these networks, concentrating on
          business applications. The effect on organisations of introducing such
          networked applications is also examined.

          The underlying aim of all courses is to develop a foundation in key
          topics related to the application of computer hardware and software in
          solving practical problems. This is a basic introduction to
          <nobr>object-oriented</nobr> programming in a modern language, namely,
          Python. Python is becoming increasingly popular as an effective means
          of introducing programming concepts to those who are new to
          programming. Students will be taught how to create simple applications
          in the Python language.

        In addition to formal courses, students undertaking postgraduate courses
        are required to participate fully in other departmental activities of an
        academic nature. Such activities are weekly seminars on environmental
        topics addressed by persons prominent in their fields, field camps and
        field exercises away from Cape Town, and study tours to obtain
        <nobr>first-hand</nobr> exposure to environmental problems and their
        solutions. Graduate students who, in the opinion of the Head of
        Department, have not had adequate exposure to undergraduate courses with
        environmental content may also be required to attend specified courses.

        This course consists of an investigation of an approved topic chosen for
        intensive study by the candidate (student), culminating in the
        submission of a dissertation. The dissertation shall demonstrate the
        successful completion of a programme of training in research methods, a
        thorough understanding of the scientific principles underlying the
        research and an appropriate acquaintance with the relevant literature.
        It must be clearly presented and conform to the standards of the
        department and faculty. The dissertation will usually consist of a
        report detailing the conduct, and analysis of the results of, research
        performed under the close guidance of a suitably qualified supervisor/s.
        The dissertation should be <nobr>well-conceived</nobr> and acknowledge
        earlier research in the field. It should demonstrate the ability to
        undertake a substantial and informed piece of research, and to collect,
        organise and analyse material. General rules for this degree may be
        found in the front of the handbook.

        research and an appropriate acquaintance with the relevant literature.
        It must be clearly presented and conform to the standards of the
        department and faculty. The dissertation will usually consist of a
        report detailing the conduct, and analysis of the results of, research
        performed under the close guidance of a suitably qualified supervisor/s.
        The dissertation should be <nobr>well-conceived</nobr> and acknowledge

        relation to metadata associated with it; phylogenetic analysis of
        sequence data; and medical population genetics from NGS or array data.
        The students who complete the course will be skilled both in handling
        big biological data sets, and in their downstream interpretation.
